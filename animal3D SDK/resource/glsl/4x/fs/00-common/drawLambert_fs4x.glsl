// ****TO-DO: 
//	-> declare varyings to receive lighting and shading variables
//	-> declare lighting uniforms
//		(hint: in the render routine, consolidate lighting data 
//		into arrays; read them here as arrays)
//	-> calculate Lambertian coefficient

//	-> implement Lambertian shading model and assign to output
//		(hint: coefficient * attenuation * light color * surface color)
//	-> implement for multiple lights
//		(hint: there is another uniform for light count)
